    <h2>A Super Food</h2>
    <p>Grilled asparagus is simple to make, but it lets you enjoy the natural flavor of your veggies. 
        Fresh asparagus spears are coated with a bit of oil, salt, and pepper and cooked quickly over 
        high heat on the grill. That's it! Pair this with marinated grilled chicken or grilled salmon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list ingredients">
        <li>Asparagus: Start with a pound of fresh, clean, trimmed asparagus.</li>
        <li>Oil: Olive oil keeps the asparagus from drying out and gives the seasonings something to stick to. </li>
        <li>Seasonings: This grilled asparagus is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="list directions">
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Lightly coat the asparagus spears with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook asparagus on the preheated grill, turning often until lightly charred and fork-tender about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
